## **Introduction**

**Sakhi** is an AI-powered application designed to combat workplace sexual harassment by providing a safe space for reporting incidents, guiding users through appropriate legal recourse with adherence to Indian law, and offering personalized support and resources. The app aims to empower women, reduce psychological distress, and create more inclusive workplaces by promoting legal awareness and access to remedies.

Built as part of the **PRAKALP - 24 Initiative**, Sakhi addresses the critical loopholes in existing systems by offering tailored legal guidance and ensuring compliance with the **POSH Act, 2013**, mandated by Indian law.

## **Problem Statement**

Workplace sexual harassment remains a significant issue. Over **50% of professionals report having experienced harassment**, but **70% of cases go unreported** due to fear of repercussions or disbelief.

1. **Document Harassment Incidents:** Provide a safe and confidential platform.
2. **Offer Legal Guidance:** Tailored to the context of Indian laws, particularly the POSH Act 2013.
3. **Provide Resources:** Connect users to mental health professionals and HR resources.
