      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          An FIR (First Information Report ) is registered by the police after
          having received a complaint by a victim of a cognizable offence, i.e.
          an offence for which police can take action without prior court
          approval (a warrant). Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
          (‘CrPC’) defines what amounts to first information. Examples include
          but are not limited to murder, rape, theft, insulting the modesty of
          women and kidnapping.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Anyone who is either a victim of a crime, or has witnessed a crime or
          has information regarding a crime may file an FIR.
        </p>

        <h4>Where can an FIR be filed?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          An FIR must be filed at the police station closest to the location of
          the crime. No police station can refuse filing of an FIR. Please note
          that every police station has a jurisdictional area within which they
          may investigate offences and crimes committed.

      <div class="question">
        <h4>What is an zero FIR?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          A Zero FIR allows for any police station to register an FIR,
          regardless of their jurisdictional area. It is usually used for crimes
          such as murder and rape and other cognizable offences, i.e. an offence
          for which police can take action without prior court approval. Initial
          action and investigation is conducted before it is transferred to the
          appropriate jurisdictional station as required. It is helpful for
          crimes that require immediate response as it allows for swifter action
          that is not bogged down by bureaucratic procedure as well as accounts
          for whether the police station under whose jurisdiction the crime was
          committed is not easily accessible.

      <div class="question">
        <h4>Why should one file an FIR?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p></p>
        An FIR is a very important document as it is one of the first steps
        towards justice for the wronged. Police take up investigation of the
        case only after registering the FIR in their respective police station.

        <h4>What is the procedure to file an FIR?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p></p>
        1. The officer must record the FIR in writing. 2. The officer must read
        the FIR back to the person filing the FIR to ensure that all details are
        correct. 3. The person filing the FIR must sign the FIR. 4. Once
        recorded, signed and registered, the person filing the FIR must get a
        copy of the FIR free of cost.

      <div class="question">
        <h4>What about after the FIR has been filed?</h4>

      <div class="answer">
        <p></p>
        1. Once an FIR has been filed the police are legally obligated to start
        investigating the case. The process of investigation includes, but is
        not limited to, collecting evidence, questioning witnesses, inspecting
        the crime scene, recording statements and forensic testing. If the
        criminals are found, the police will make arrests. 2. Once the
        investigation has been concluded the police will record all their
        findings in a ‘Challan’ or charge sheet. If it is deemed that there is
        enough proof on the charge sheet the case goes to court. 3. If, after
        the investigation, the police conclude that there is not enough evidence
        that a crime has been committed they may close the case after justifying
        their reasons in court. If the police decide to close the case, they are
        obligated to inform the person who filed the FIR of their decision.

      <div class="question">
        <h4>What can you do if your FIR is not registered?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p></p>
        1. You can meet the Superintendent of Police or other higher officers
        like Deputy Inspector General of Police and Inspector General of Police
        and bring your complaint to their notice. 2. You can send your complaint
        in writing and by post to the Superintendent of Police concerned. If the
        Superintendent of Police is satisfied with your complaint, he shall
        either investigate the case himself or order an investigation to be
        made. 3. You can file a private complaint before the court having
        jurisdiction. 4. You can also make a complaint to the State Human Rights
        Commission or the National Human Rights Commission if the police do
        nothing to enforce the law or does it in a biased and corrupt manner.

        <h4>Are there alternate steps available to filing an FIR?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p></p>
        Yes, there are alternate steps to filing an FIR, for women. You can call
        to the National Commission for Women (ideal if there is a refusal to
        file an FIR)

        <p></p>
        1. Counselling: Counselling services are provided to the aggrieved and
        she would be told about the status of law and various options available
        to her. 2. Resolution through alternative methods: the NCW through its
        panel of experts would arrange for the mediation between the parties. 3.
        In certain cases, the victim may choose to settle the matter with the
        perpetrator of the crime. 4. If you can identify the person then the
        person will be tracked and put in judicial custody within 24 hours
        unless he/ she has crossed the city limits. 5. A charge sheet is filed,
        witnesses are called and interrogated as required. The documents are
        filed with the FIR and the sessions court takes over from there.
